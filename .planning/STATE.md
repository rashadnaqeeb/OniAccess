# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-11)

**Core value:** A blind player can play a full colony with an experience designed for audio, not a translation of the visual interface.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing phase
Last activity: 2026-02-11 -- Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (project scaffolding, speech engine)

Progress: [#.........] 3%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2min)
- Trend: --

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Observe-before-act ordering -- entity inspection immediately follows world navigation so player understands what they find before overlays and colony management
- [Roadmap]: META requirements distributed to Phase 1 (foundation) and Phase 2 (help system)
- [Roadmap]: Duplicant management and entity inspection split into separate phases for depth
- [Roadmap revised]: Entity Inspection moved from Phase 8 to Phase 4 -- after navigating to entities, player should inspect them before diving into overlays and colony management
- [Roadmap revised]: Duplicant Management moved from Phase 8 to Phase 7 -- must control workforce before issuing construction or area tool orders
- [Roadmap revised]: Area Tools split out of Building & Construction into new Phase 8 -- area tools (dig, mop, sweep, harvest, capture, attack, disinfect, empty pipe, etc.) interact with the existing world, distinct from placing new structures
- [Roadmap revised]: BUILD-08 (cancel orders) and BUILD-10 (tool commands) moved to Phase 8 (Area Tools); new AREA-01 through AREA-08 requirements added for full area tool coverage
- [01-01]: LocString entries in STRINGS namespace for full localization support from day one
- [01-01]: Tolk_Silence for Stop() instead of empty string Tolk_Output -- cleaner API usage
- [01-01]: OnSpeechOutput callback as internal Action<string> for test capture hook point
- [01-01]: RegisterForTranslation called in OnLoad to enable community translations

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Speech.cs already exists with Tolk integration -- Phase 1 should build on it, not rewrite
- Research flags Phase 5 (Overlays) and Phase 4 (Entity Inspection) as needing deeper research before planning
- 100+ building side screen variants in Phase 4 will need per-screen adapter pattern
