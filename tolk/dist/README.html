<h1 id="tolk-screen-reader-abstraction-library">Tolk: Screen Reader
Abstraction Library</h1>
<p>NOTE: this project is not currently being developed.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Tolk is an application extension (DLL) that allows Windows
applications to output text through screen reader software (assistive
technology for the blind and visually impaired). It is an abstraction
layer on top of the vendor-specific APIs that auto-detects the active
screen reader, allowing for clean and simple client code. Speech and
braille output are supported in 32-bit and 64-bit environments. See
<code>Supported screen readers</code> for more details. In addition to
screen readers, Microsoft Speech API (SAPI) is also supported. The name
Tolk is a Dutch word meaning interpreter.</p>
<p>There are APIs for the following languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>C/C++</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Microsoft .NET (C# and VB)</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>AutoIt</li>
<li>PureBasic</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>Tolk is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License
version 3 (LGPLv3). Client libraries and headers are distributed under
their own license.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>The key components of Tolk are the screen reader drivers. They wrap a
specific screen reader API into an abstract interface which is then used
by Tolk’s auto-detection mechanism. SAPI, albeit not a screen reader,
also has its own driver. To keep things simple and secure, these screen
reader drivers are not exposed to client code.</p>
<p>Functions that output text or that silence speech are asynchronous.
That is, they return immediately once the appropriate commands have been
queued for processing by the active screen reader. All other functions
are synchronous. That is, they return only when their work is done.</p>
<p>Finally, a few words on multi-threaded applications. Tolk is not
thread-safe. Also, some of the screen reader drivers use COM. You have
two options for initializing COM:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Call <code>Tolk_Load</code> on every thread that uses Tolk. Match
every call by a call to <code>Tolk_Unload</code>. Tolk will initialize
COM if required.</li>
<li>Initialize and uninitialize COM yourself and call
<code>Tolk_Load</code> only once in your application. You still need a
matching call to <code>Tolk_Unload</code>. This is also what you should
do in languages that automatically deal with COM, e.g. .NET.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Tolk has functions for (un)initialization, querying and using the
active screen reader, and for working with Microsoft SAPI. To use Tolk,
import the appropriate version of <code>Tolk.dll</code> into your
application. In C/C++ this is usually done by including
<code>Tolk.h</code> and linking with the appropriate import library
<code>Tolk.lib</code>. You could also use the Windows API functions
<code>LoadLibrary</code> and <code>FreeLibrary</code>. Other languages
are also supported, see <code>Wrappers</code>. If you’re working in an
unsupported language, use its specific facilities to call into the
DLL.</p>
<h3 id="required-files">Required files</h3>
<p>The <code>lib</code> directory contains the required screen reader
API DLLs. Tolk expects these DLLs to be found either in the current
working directory or somewhere in the <code>PATH</code>. If a DLL for a
screen reader is not found, that screen reader will be unavailable. Note
that some screen readers use COM and therefore don’t need API DLLs.</p>
<h3 id="loading">Loading</h3>
<p>Before using Tolk you need to initialize it with
<code>Tolk_Load</code>, and uninitialize it with
<code>Tolk_Unload</code> when you are done. You can then use all the
other functions.</p>
<h3 id="outputting-text">Outputting text</h3>
<p>The most important way to send text to the active screen reader is
using <code>Tolk_Output</code>. The first parameter to this function is
the Unicode string of text, the second parameter indicates whether or
not previously queued speech should be interrupted (or canceled,
flushed, etc). In languages that support this feature, the second
parameter is optional and defaults to <code>false</code>. The advantage
of using <code>Tolk_Output</code> is that it tries both speech and
braille. If you need something more specialized, use
<code>Tolk_Speak</code> for speech, <code>Tolk_Braille</code> for
braille and <code>Tolk_Silence</code> to interrupt previously queued
speech. All these functions return <code>true</code> on success and
<code>false</code> otherwise, but because of the auto-detection
mechanism it is recommended (and safe) to discard this return value and
simply insert the required calls wherever you need screen reader output.
This keeps your code clean and straight-forward.</p>
<h3 id="querying-status">Querying status</h3>
<p>There are functions to find out more about the active screen reader
driver. You can get the name of the currently active screen reader
through <code>Tolk_DetectScreenReader</code>. This returns the name as
Unicode string or <code>NULL</code> if none of the supported screen
readers is active. As the name implies, this function tries
auto-detection if required. Internally, Tolk’s other functions use this,
so it is not necessary to call this yourself unless you actually need
the common name. If a screen reader is active, you can use
<code>Tolk_HasSpeech</code> and <code>Tolk_HasBraille</code> to find out
whether the driver supports speech or braille, respectively. For
synchronization, <code>Tolk_IsSpeaking</code> returns whether or not the
active screen reader is speaking text at the time of the call, assuming
the driver supports this query. Note that not many drivers implement
this functionality because of limitations in screen reader APIs. See the
<code>Status</code> column of the <code>Supported screen readers</code>
table for details. There is no such function for braille, since braille
is instantaneous.</p>
<h3 id="using-sapi">Using SAPI</h3>
<p>Tolk can output text through Microsoft SAPI. This is mostly meant as
a fallback mechanism. To do this, Tolk has a screen reader driver that
uses SAPI 5.3. Therefore, the functionality is limited to what screen
reader drivers provide. Applications that need more control should use
SAPI directly. Another consequence is that there is no way to explicitly
tell Tolk to use SAPI, the driver is part of the auto-detection
chain.</p>
<p>By default, support for SAPI is disabled. To change this, use
<code>Tolk_TrySAPI</code>, passing <code>true</code> to enable SAPI or
<code>false</code> to disable it. The required driver will automatically
be (un)loaded. SAPI is initially put at the end of the auto-detection
chain. This is good for using it as a fallback option when none of the
supported screen readers is running. It is also possible to have Tolk
prefer SAPI over the other screen reader drivers. This is good for basic
SAPI output where screen readers are only tried if SAPI fails or if SAPI
5.3 or later is unavailable. To change the preference for SAPI, use
<code>Tolk_PreferSAPI</code>. This also takes a boolean parameter,
<code>true</code> to prefer SAPI or <code>false</code> to prefer the
traditional screen readers. The most efficient way of enabling SAPI
support is to set it up before calling <code>Tolk_Load</code>. However,
you can also call these functions after Tolk has already been loaded.
This will trigger the screen reader detection process and is therefore
slightly less efficient.</p>
<h3 id="wrappers">Wrappers</h3>
<p>Wrappers around <code>Tolk.dll</code> have been added for some
languages to make things easier:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Tolk.jar</code> for Java</li>
<li><code>TolkDotNet.dll</code> for C#/VB.NET</li>
<li><code>Tolk.pyo</code> for Python</li>
<li><code>Tolk.au3</code> for AutoIt</li>
<li><code>Tolk.pb</code> for PureBasic</li>
</ul>
<p>The wrappers cover all functions and use the language’s native types
where possible. The function names have also been adapted to meet the
specific conventions for these languages.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Take a look at the <code>examples</code> directory to get started.
This directory contains console applications in the supported languages
that demonstrate the basic usage. Note that Microsoft SAPI will stop
speaking when your application closes, which means that it will not work
with these console applications because they return immediately after
queueing text. Add a short delay (sleep) to work around this if you want
to try SAPI.</p>
<h2 id="supported-screen-readers">Supported screen readers</h2>
<p>The following table lists the supported screen readers in the order
in which they are auto-detected.</p>
<pre><code>Screen Reader   Speech   Braille   Status   x86   x64
JAWS            Yes      Yes       No       Yes   Yes
Window-Eyes     Yes      Yes       No       Yes   Yes
NVDA            Yes      Yes       No       Yes   Yes
SuperNova       Yes      No        No       Yes   No
System Access   Yes      Yes       No       Yes   Yes
ZoomText        Yes      No        Yes      Yes   Yes
SAPI            Yes      No        Yes      Yes   Yes</code></pre>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>SuperNova is the only screen reader that does not have a 64-bit
compatible API.</li>
<li>SuperNova has support for braille, but the API does not let you use
it.</li>
<li>SuperNova can speak even if the user turned the voice off, but in
that state interrupts will not work.</li>
<li>Some screen readers (notably Window-Eyes and ZoomText) support many
more functions, but there are no plans to implement any of them.</li>
<li>The driver for Microsoft SAPI explicitly disables XML handling
because there is no way to be sure SAPI is being used and other drivers
don’t support this.</li>
<li>Window-Eyes is obsolete, but support has not yet been removed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>If you want to compile Tolk yourself, here’s what you need to build
the whole thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Visual C++</li>
<li>Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)</li>
<li>Java Development Kit (JDK)</li>
<li>Microsoft .NET Framework</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Pandoc</li>
</ul>
<p>The root directory and <code>examples</code> directories contain
various batch files as a starting point. They assume the required tools
are in your <code>PATH</code> and that the JDK include directory is in
<code>INCLUDE</code>. For the examples you will also need to copy over
any dependency files.</p>
